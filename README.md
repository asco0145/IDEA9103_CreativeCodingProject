### **Instuctions**
To engage with this work, user input is required.
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the sky:
*Press the **Up Arrow** to increase the speed.
*Press the **Down Arrow** to decrease the speed.

Lastly, the Scream figure reacts to mouse movement.

When you hover the cursor over the figure, it grows in size and returns to normal once the cursor moves away.
### **Individual Animation Approach**
#### **Chosen Driver: Interaction**
For my individual contribution, I chose user interaction as the main driver for animation. Rather than relying on time or Perlin noise, my section responds directly to the user's input, creating a more engaging and controllable experience. I wanted users to feel like they were influencing the mood and motion of The Scream rather than passively observing it.

#### **Animated Properties and Uniqueness**
Two key properties of the artwork are animated:
1. **Sky Movement and Speed:** The swirling strokes of the sky respond to user key input. Pressing the up arrow increases the sky’s movement speed, while pressing the down arrow decreases it. This lets users control how turbulent or calm the environment feels, mimicking the emotional tension of the original painting.
2. **Figure Transformation (The Scream):** The central figure grows when hovered over with the mouse. This interaction creates a sense of intensity, as if the user’s attention amplifies the figure’s anxiety and presence. When the mouse moves away, the figure smoothly returns to its normal size.
This approach makes my contribution distinct from my group members, whose components are automated by time, sound, or color shifts. My animation instead invites direct manipulation and personal input from the viewer.

#### **Inspirations**
My inspiration came from interactive digital art installations where viewer proximity or gestures influence the artwork’s behavior. I was particularly inspired by works from Refik Anadol, who uses real-time data and motion to create evolving digital canvases. The idea of the artwork reacting to a human presence influenced my decision to make The Scream reactive to both mouse movement and key input.
