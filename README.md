### **Instuctions**
To engage with this work, user input is required.
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the sky:
*Press the **Up Arrow** to increase the speed.
*Press the **Down Arrow** to decrease the speed.

Lastly, the Scream figure reacts to mouse movement.

When you hover the cursor over the figure, it grows in size and returns to normal once the cursor moves away.
